    ðŸ’™ Static Blog Builder is <s>loosely based on</s> a complete ripoff of the
    <a href="https://bearblog.dev/" alt="bear blogging platform" target="_blank"
      >bear blogging platform</a
    >. If what you're looking for is a minimal, text-only blogging platform and
    you don't care about hosting it yourself, close this page and go check out
    bear!

    I made ðŸ’™ Static Blog Builder because I love the bear blogging platform but
    wanted some additional customizations.

    Read the full story on my blog about why I think platforms like bear are
    perfect for blogging and an antidote for many of web's current maladies. A
    tutorial on hosting on AWS is also included.
