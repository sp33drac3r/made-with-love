    My whole life I’ve been captivated by new products. I was a child of the
    information age and growing up felt like everyday was a new and exciting
    future. When I was maybe 8 my dad brought home a Zip drive for work. He told
    me that a single Zip disk could fit the complete works of Shakespear. Today

    I was an avid reader of Popular Science magazine. I remember one cover that
    predicted the next big thing:

    >. A one stop shop MP3 player, phone, palm pilot. When Steve Jobs announced
    the iPhone many years later I thought, “here it is. The future is now.”

    I didn’t have much of a method when I first started noodling on new product
    ideas. Inspired by the combination mp3 player / phone idea I thought, “what
    other combo products should there be?” To my parents' horror, I once
    explained in great detail over dinner about an idea I had for a Lay-Z-Boy /
    toilet. Kick up your feet, flip on the game and take a nice, comfortable
    dump. My trash heap of discarded ideas is deep and diverse but every idea in
    it has one thing in common - I thought it was a winner at the time.

  <p>
    And so too many of the ideas I share here will one day look stupid. But
    that’s OK. These product ideas keep building up in my head and I need a
    place to put them. The ideas themselves have no real value because most of
    them aren’t great. And more and more I realize that I’ll only ever be able
    to chase after a precious few. Rarely does one meet the requirements of
    being a problem that I have the expertise to solve, capital to move forward
    and time to allocate toward it’s development.

    So, here you go. Here are some ideas. Make of them what you will.
