  <h1>A New Mission</h1>
  <p>
    As I write this, Just Eat Takeaway has just announced that it intends to
    purchase menu aggregator and food delivery service, GrubHub, for $7 billion.
    Just Eat Takeaway got its mouthful of a name after Takeway.com acquired Just
    Eat for $8 billion. If the .com in the official name weren’t enough of a
    clue that we have, somehow, been flung back to the ‘90s, their business
    model makes it clear - Just Eat Takeaway is just a takeout marketplace.
    Another word for marketplace is aggregator or middleman or perhaps more
    succinctly, dirty dirty thief.
  </p>
  <p>
    Heather Haddon and Parmy Olson, writers for the Wall Street Journal, got
    <a
      href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/strategy-behind-blockbuster-grubhub-deal-dont-deliver-11593266407"
      target="_blank"
      >a fabulous pull quote</a
    >
    from the new, wouldbe head of Grubhub.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      “Mr. Groen, 42 years old, who would become chief executive of the
      combination with Grubhub, describes the approach as based simply on
      facilitating messages between restaurants and customers. “As long as we
      send messages, we make money,” he said. ‘That’s why marketplace is just a
      superior business model.’”
    </i>
  </p>
  <p>
    How is it possible that a message platform is worth $7 billion? Quite
    simply, it’s not. The majority of their value comes from taking a fraction
    of the sale, upwards of 30%, often without providing a delivery fleet as
    most consumers assume they do. So what value are they providing? They
    provide the currency of robber barons everywhere: exposure.
  </p>
  <p>
    These types of vain, extractive companies like DoorDash, Yelp, Uber Eats,
    etc. etc., are what is giving tech its bad name. “Entrepreneurs” have been
    using the same playbook over and over: slap a minimally-functional front end
    on an aggregation API, spend millions of dollars of VC money on advertising
    and customer acquisition and then squeeze every last drop of margin out of
    the mom-and-pop shops they aggregate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consumers are willing to adopt this model because there is no clear
    alternative. While these platforms are trivial to make in the technical
    sense they are far out of reach for any individual food and/or beverage
    company short of Starbucks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine if tech treated itself this way. Imagine if choosing to use Postgres
    meant you had to surrender 30% of your revenue upfront. It shouldn’t be
    difficult to imagine, this is basically what Oracle is offering. But in the
    tech community we have alternatives. I don’t know a founding engineer today
    who is reaching for an Oracle database as the persistence layer of their
    stack.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why would I use Oracle when I can use Postgres?<sup>1</sup> Postgres is
    free. And it’s good! Really really good and it only continues to get better.
    Hundreds of thousands of person-hours have been spent on all sorts of
    features from different join algorithms that perform better on certain kinds
    of queries to the ability to tune vacuuming parameters and so on. It is true
    that if you have a problem, you have no one you can call or yell at... or
    sue. But in exchange, you get a thriving, friendly community of developers
    eager to help.
  </p>
  <p>
    Postgres is just one example. There are thousands more. And even the big
    players like Microsoft are going full bore into the open source arena
    because they are worried that even they may be foregoing a floating boat if
    they don’t contribute to this rising tide.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, why do software engineers write such good software for themselves and
    nobody else? In fact, why do software engineers write free software at all?
    As far as I can tell, it is mostly because software engineers enjoy writing
    software. There is inherent value to producing something that other people
    find useful. And there are few things quite so satisfying as reaching for a
    well-defined, open-source product that you know you can rely on.
  </p>
  <p>
    But while we have been working hard to author exceptional, free technology
    for ourselves, the average consumer has been left out in the cold. There are
    a number of barriers to writing software for non-coders. For one, coders
    have a deep understanding of the kinds of things other coders want and a
    mindset that allows them to write interfaces they are likely to understand.
    Anyone who has worked in a domain they aren’t familiar with can attest to
    the difficulty of having to learn new domain specific lingo or having to
    adhere to interaction patterns that may be outmoded in tech but are familiar
    and even expected in finance, for instance. Most importantly, tech just
    isn’t that familiar with the problems other sectors face and so cannot
    accurately address their needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The free software community needs to adopt a new mission - to make
    excellent, free, software for <strong>non-technical consumers</strong>. The
    only way to do this is to collaborate.
  </p>
  <p>
    How many person-hours would it take to make a great takeout menu aggregator
    and customer to restaurant messaging platform? Not that many, I submit. Our
    community has solved far harder problems in the past and now more than ever
    we have giant, free shoulders to stand on.
  </p>
  <p>
    If we can pivot the free software movement to focus on delivering value for
    non-technical consumers, what is on offer, instead of adulation from our
    peers, is appreciation from everyone. We could restore tech’s name,
    participate globally in new and exciting domains, and spread value around
    instead of concentrating it in the tiny, clenched hands of the silicon
    valley few.
  </p>
  <p>
    If this mission had a mantra, I think it could be:
    <strong>make free software your mom wants to use.</strong>
  </p>
