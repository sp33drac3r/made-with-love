  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    My whole life I‚Äôve been captivated by new products. I was a child of the
    information age and growing up felt like everyday was a new and exciting
    future. When I was maybe 8 my dad brought home a Zip drive for work. He told
    me that a single Zip disk could fit the complete works of Shakespear. Today
    the complete works of Shakespeare and fit

  </p>
  <p>
    I was an avid reader of Popular Science magazine. I remember one cover that
    predicted the next big thing:
    <a
      href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dAAAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA95&ots=uevYLXfz2j&dq=popular%20science%20covers%20mp3%20player%20makes%20phone%20calls&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q=popular%20science%20covers%20mp3%20player%20makes%20phone%20calls&f=false"

      >the all in one device</a
    >. A one stop shop MP3 player, phone, palm pilot. When Steve Jobs announced
    the iPhone many years later I thought, ‚Äúhere it is. The future is now.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn‚Äôt have much of a method when I first started noodling on new product
    ideas. Inspired by the combination mp3 player / phone idea I thought, ‚Äúwhat
    other combo products should there be?‚Äù To my parents' horror, I once
    explained in great detail over dinner about an idea I had for a Lay-Z-Boy /
    toilet. Kick up your feet, flip on the game and take a nice, comfortable
    dump. My trash heap of discarded ideas is deep and diverse but every idea in
    it has one thing in common - I thought it was a winner at the time.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so too many of the ideas I share here will one day look stupid. But
    that‚Äôs OK. These product ideas keep building up in my head and I need a
    place to put them. The ideas themselves have no real value because most of
    them aren‚Äôt great. And more and more I realize that I‚Äôll only ever be able
    to chase after a precious few. Rarely does one meet the requirements of
    being a problem that I have the expertise to solve, capital to move forward
    and time to allocate toward it‚Äôs development.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, here you go. Here are some ideas. Make of them what you will.
